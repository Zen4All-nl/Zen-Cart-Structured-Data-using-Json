# Zen-Cart-Structured-Data-using-Json
There already are several Structured Data modules available for Zen Cart, but this one does not hack core files. Instead the data is generated through Json files

There will be multiple Json files, each controling a different part of the structured data mark up.
- structured_data_product.php
- structured_data_breadcrumb.php
- structured_data_organisation.php
- structured_data_website.php
- structured_data_professional_service.php
